# LaTeX-classes
LaTeX classes I use for maths posts

## Setup

1. Install the fonts in the fonts folder
2. Place the contents of the package folder in :
    - `~/texmf/tex/latex/` if you use UNIX systems with texlive
    - `localtexmf/tex/latex/` if you're using miktex on Windows. You can create this directory wherever you want but don't forget to go to the miktex console and add localtexmf as a new root and refresh file name data base.
3. Enjoy

> [!WARNING]  
> You need to use XeLaTeX to work with the classes. Compiling with LaTeX will throw errors.
